# Set Covering
As mentioned in the lecture, the **set cover problem** is an NP-complete problem. In this task, you will solve this question using both exhausive search (brute force) and greedy apporach. 

The problem is defined as follow:

Given a `list` of `sets` where each `set` contains integers, please find the minimum number of sets that cover the integers from `1` to `10`

For example, given the following three sets:
1. `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
1. `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
1. `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

Your code should find that `set1` and `set3` will cover all the integers from `1` to `10`.

## Exercise 1: Set cover - brute force 

First, implement the brute force approach that tests `all` combinations. You can assume there will be a solution. To simplify your code a bit, you can use the `itertools`. Please read its document and examples below:
