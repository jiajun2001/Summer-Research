# Summer Research Project by Jiajun Yu and Jian Zhe Chan #
Research Topic: Analyze the output of code quality feedback tools for novice programmers and develop a tool that picks up details missed by the existing tools 

## Description ##
- Familiarized with the use and features of two code quality checking tools.
- Used BASH programs and Python to analyze outputs of Pylint and Hyperstyle generated from codes submitted by students (Jupyter Notebook, Python, Java files), and used excel to visualize the data. 
- Developed a tool to filter Pylint error codes in groups.
- Developed a tool to pick up code smells that are missed by the existing code quality checking tools
